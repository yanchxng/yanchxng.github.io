                <h1>About Justin Bieber</h1>
                <p>Justin Drew Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. He was raised by his mother, Pattie Mallette. She worked at several jobs to support herself and her son. As a young child, Justin loved to play chess and sports, especially hockey and soccer. He also loved music and learned to play guitar, drums, piano, and trumpet.</p>
                <p>In 2007, he entered a local singing contest and won second place. His mother posted a video of his performance on YouTube. She later added other homemade videos of Justin singing and playing guitar. A music promoter saw Justin's videos and invited him to record songs at a studio in Atlanta, Georgia. While there, Justin met Usher. Usher helped Justin get a record deal in late 2008.</p>
